Match Fynder: Matching groups to a nearby restaurant

## Intended market

-People who want to eat food from a restaurant
-People who've struggled to agree on where to eat

## Functionality

--Site includes a Main page and About Page with company info and FAQ. The Account setup/login modals are accessible from either page.
--Visitors to the site can set up an account which allows them to create a new search.
--Searches involve entering a location (zipcode OR city, state) and inviting participants (other account holders or simply people with an email address)
--Once a search is created, it is populated via options from the Fynder database and google maps API
--Every search participant can engage in approving (or vetoing) options. Participants can click on links to each restaurant's web page to learn more.
--Once every participant has approved any particular option, all participants have access to the 'Match Made' page
--Participants earn fun 'badges' based upon their engagement in the search (eg: "picky eater" (most vetos) "decisive devourer" (fastest) "fastidious feaster" (most research) "giddy gastronomer" (most approvals))
